# PyInstaller spec for florr-auto-pathing.
#
# Build ON THE TARGET OS — PyInstaller does not cross-compile. For a Windows
# .exe this must run on the Windows machine (see build_windows.bat).
#
# maps/ is deliberately NOT bundled as --add-data: the code reads it via a
# relative path ("./maps/...") resolved against the process's cwd, which for
# a double-clicked exe is the exe's own folder. Bundling it into PyInstaller's
# internal _internal/ dir (default since PyInstaller 6.0) would break that
# lookup. The build script copies maps/ next to the built exe instead.
#
# canvas_hook.js IS bundled: cdp_bridge.py loads it relative to its OWN module
# file (Path(__file__), or sys._MEIPASS when frozen), not the cwd — so it must
# ride inside _internal/ next to the frozen modules, which is where a datas
# entry with dest "." lands and where cdp_bridge's frozen branch looks.
